# Baby Django

This is a project for trying to re-create the `very basics` of Django to better learn how it works internally. Part of the code comes from _learning_ how to handle what the low level stuff is/does, and the other comes from digging into _how_ django works to better demonstrate it.

## Note (Not a Production App)
This is for example and learning purposes. It is not meant to be an alternative to Django or even used in any production model ever.
